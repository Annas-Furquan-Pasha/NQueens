# NQueens

N-Quuens is a classical Backtracting problem in which we place N queens in N x N board such that no two queens kill each other.

The Queen here refers to, one of the pieces in the Game of Chess.

The Program is written in Java,
 and shows the position of the Queen as '1' on the board and board itself as N x N matrix, and remaining positions as '0'.
 
 And Only the first possible solution is displayed.
